{"title":"Hi! I’m Peter Rosenthal","paragraphs":["I’m a creative technologist with a fundamental belief that technology is for everyone, regardless of age, ability, or even spoken language. Currently I’m applying that belief to the realm of software, but my interests lie in anything and everything technical. I also have a passion for play; it can elevate any interaction, and it’s especially fun to create play using technology.","I have a Master’s degree in Creative Technology and Design, and I currently work as a software engineer (and designer) at Lingoport, where I am helping create tools to help other companies internationalize their softwares.","Welcome to my portfolio where you can view my projects and see how I attempt to combine all of my interests into one!"]}
