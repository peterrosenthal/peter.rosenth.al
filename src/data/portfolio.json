The game, which takes place in a garden within your mind, allows you to import any song you want to play alongside. However, the song isn’t just an accessory to the game; it is the game. The song is broken into pieces and scattered throughout your head, and it is your task to find them and unite the song. As you search for the pieces of the song, don’t forget to take a look at the garden around you, and watch the plants as they interact with the music that’s playing. The game is free to download and play from our <a href=”https://jaristotle.itch.io/minds”>itch.io page</a> for it!"},{"type":"image","url":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15mB9d-RX9UzIAhnh_1bFPu0Qn2Ue8V45","alt":"ALT TEXT PLEASE FILL OUT LATER!"},{"type":"subheading","text":"Process"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I created Mind’s Garden with two of my classmates from the ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder.
