The game, which takes place in a garden within your mind, allows you to import any song you want to play alongside. However, the song isn’t just an accessory to the game; it is the game! The song is broken into pieces and scattered throughout your “head”, and it is your task to find them and unite the song. As you search for the pieces of the song, don’t forget to take a look at the garden around you, and watch the plants as they interact with the music that’s playing.

Jared was the gameplay programmer, coding things such as the asset and objective placement around the map. For my part: I did a lot of programming too, but I focused more on the systems programming. I created things such as the game’s procedural terrain generation algorithm, as well as systems to manage all of our 800+ different colors and determine how those colors interacted with  songs. I was also responsible for creating the different builds of the game for different operating systems as I had the most access and experience with multiple operating systems other than Microsoft Windows. And to give my artistic skills a test, I designed and drew our logo for the game."},{"type":"image","url":"https://i.imgur.com/8wQw3sA.png","alt":"The logo which I crafted for the Mind’s Garden game!"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One of my main goals throughout the project was to always code with my teammates in mind. That meant that instead of just designing and developing “my parts” of the game, I’d create and share tools with my teammates so they could give direct hands-on input on my designs. For example, I didn’t just create a piece of procedurally generated terrain, I created a tool to create a piece of procedurally generated terrain, and opened it up to my entire team to work together on designing the ground the player walks on.

We were able to show people over zoom though, and send people the link to download the game themselves, and despite the lack of in person experience, most people were still super excited about our concept and really enjoyed exploring our interactive garden world. We had enough different color schemes to choose from that there was something for everybody to love there too. And our simple controls made the game super easy to give to people of all ages; kids absolutely loved our game. However, our 12 week development time felt very cramped for such an ambitious project, and we didn’t get the chance to iron out every single bug. So while most people are able to play the game without ever encountering a bug, we’ve gotten too many reports of people not even being able to make it past the main menu to consider the game “bug free.” Even though the capstone project is long finished, I still hope to one day come back though and squash those last few remaining bugs."}]}},{"slug":"gosutoraito","entry":{"title":"Gosutoraito","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/KFvPlNM.jpg","alt":"Thumbnail for the Gosutoraito project, shows a small wooden temple in a snowy hillside."},"contents":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Gosutoraito is a first person atmospheric puzzle game set in a ghostly temple.

The game was created over the course of 6-8 weeks, which is not much time, and yet it was the biggest project and longest any of us had dedicated yet to working on a video game at the time. Kara worked on most of the visual assets of the game, like 3D models and environmental effects, and Jared did all of the level design and any coding/development that went with that. I wanted to work on my skills in both areas. Most of my time working on this project was dedicated to programming things such as our unique player controls and our reflection math, but I also spent some time creating a 3D model of a ghost and improving small graphical things in the game, like the look of the light beam, something central to every level."},{"type":"image","url":"https://i.imgur.com/J4L9Jub.jpg","alt":"A beam of light shines down from the ceiling of the temple into the puzzles."},{"type":"image","url":"https://i.imgur.com/Xdmj1fN.jpg","alt":"The beam of light is reflected throughout the puzzle on mirrors."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"My team created a process blog for this project that you can read on the project’s GitHub repository for more insight into our design and development process for the game!"},{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/peterrosenthal/gosutoraito/tree/master/process","text":"Gosutoratio on GitHub"},{"type":"subheading","text":"Tools"},{"type":"list","entries":["The Unity Game Engine","C# and JetBrains Rider","Autodesk Maya","Adobe Photoshop"]},{"type":"subheading","text":"Reception"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"“That’s kind of racist.” -Zhenghua Yang, Founder and CEO of Serenity Forge"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"He was referring specifically to the hat we put on one of the ghosts to indicate that they were a farmer before being trapped in the afterlife. We went through after the final presentation to remove that hat, but upon further reflection, those words really do go beyond just a hat. We were 3 white kids trying to make a game with heavy Eastern spiritual themes. The name was literally just Google Translate to Japanese for “ghost light,” and none of us really had enough cultural knowledge to make anything else about the game legitimate, so the spiritual themes were pretty much just whatever we wanted. And that… that’s kind of racist."},{"type":"image","url":"https://i.imgur.com/0xTAhJ0.jpg","alt":"Two ghosts chase the player down as they try to solve the puzzles.

The game had a good learning and difficulty curve, and the final few levels were surprisingly more challenging than any of us had anticipated. The light reflection mechanic turned out to be an inspiration in the master’s thesis project of Maria Deslis, a fellow ATLAS student at the time. That project, Eternal Eclipse, also borrowed the control scheme I developed, since as a team we decided to open source our game!"}]}}]
